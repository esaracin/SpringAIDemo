This project consists of a barebones Spring Web application that uses the OpenAI API to generate text based on user input. 

It is designed to be built and run using Gradle, with support for both container images and native executables.

It is intended to showcase some of the basic SpringAI capabilities, such as:
- Simple user prompts 
- System prompts, and chatClientBuilder configuration 
- Tool use 
- Implicit schema enforcement with Records 
- Changing AI backend with low/no code changes

It is heavily adapted from the examples found from Craig Walls' Github, [here](https://github.com/habuma/spring-ai-examples)
